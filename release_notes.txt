Version 0.3
==================================================================================================

New Features
------------
*Resource archives through multifile resource locations that allows resources to be located in an archive 
 and distributed as a single file.
*Hotspot maps for 2d nodes using quadtree image representations (pano.model.quadImg.QImageMap) or plain images. 
*Definition of clickable area of a hotspot through images. This separates the viewing area of a hotspot 
 with its interactive part as they do not necessarily match.
*New built-in node screen2d allows to use screen coordinates for placing and sizing nodepaths
*Paging and scrolling for inventory 
*Examples for: music playlists, 2d nodes, multifiles, hotspot maps, multifiles, sounds playback
 
Changes
-------
*The sound player no longer uses weak references for sounds, instead it removes all finished sounds by
 scanning all sounds in its update method.
*NodeScript are loaded as text files using the resource loader.
*All options in configuration files must be in lower case because the current parsing framework lowers 
 the case of the property names.
*Added the method getResourcesLocation to retrieve registered locations by name.
*Added the method MousePointerDisplay.getPosition that returns the current position of the pointer.
*Added render orders in PanoConstants and replaced custom bins with specific render order constants
*Added Inventory.getNumUniqueItems
*simplified GameView.convertAspectToScreenCoords and GameView.convertScreenToAspectCoords moved to PandaUtil
 and simplified through screen2d

Fixes
-----
*Minor fixes in Node2DRenderer when the aspect parent was chosen, manifested when running the sounds example.
*Line delimiters are automatically converted to Unix-style for node scripts, as the Python parser demands.
*The BOM marker is detected and stripped when loading text resources.
*2d rendered was setting up the aspect ration incorrectl
*explore state will display a hotspot's description only if one is set
*added updateResourcesLocation which was missing
