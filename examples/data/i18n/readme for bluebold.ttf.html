In Windows, you take the fonts out of the ZIP archive and place them in
your fonts folder which can be found in your Control Panel. The next
time you run your software, the font will be available. For example: If
you install a new font, the next time you run Microsoft Word, that font
will be available in the menu under Format / Font. For anything more
complicated, or Mac installation, visit <a href="http://www.larabiefonts.com/help.html">www.larabiefonts.com/help.html</a></li></font></ul><ul><font face="Georgia"><li>Q: How can I use this font in <a href="http://www.aol.com/aim/">AOL Instant Messenger</a>, <a href="http://messenger.msn.com/">MSN Messenger</a>, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/outlook/">Outlook</a>, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/outlook/">Outlook Express</a>, <a href="http://www.eudora.com/">Euodora</a> or any other email software?</li><li>A:
At the time of this writing (Feb 2004) you can&#8217;t. After installing one
of my fonts, you may be able to select it in the above applications but
the person at the other end won&#8217;t see that same thing unless they have
the font installed. If you really want to use my fonts in these
applications, make sure the people at the other end have the same fonts
installed.</li></font></ul><ul><font face="Georgia"><li>Q: How can I use these fonts on a web page?</li><li>A: If you&#8217;re creating a web page using Flash, it&#8217;s easy. Consult your Flash manual. If you&#8217;re using <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/">Acrobat</a>,
make sure the font embedding settings are turned on. Consult your
Acrobat manual. For anything else there are limitations: If you want to
use one of my fonts as your main, text font you&#8217;re pretty much out of
luck unless you explore a font embedding tool such as <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/web/embedding/weft/">WEFT</a> but I don&#8217;t recommend it. To use my fonts as headings or titles, use image creation software such as <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">The Gimp</a>, <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/">Photoshop</a>, <a href="http://www.jasc.com/">Paint Shop Pro</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=pixia">Pixia</a>
etc. Save the images as GIF files and place them on your web page.
There&#8217;s a lot more to it than can be explained here but there are
countless books available on web page design.</li></font></ul><ul><font face="Georgia"><li>Q: How can I make these fonts bigger?</li><li>A:
All my fonts are infinitely scalable; the limitations are in your
software. A common problem is scaling fonts in Microsoft Word. If you
choose Format / Font you can type in any number you like under &#8220;size&#8221;.</li></font></ul><ul><font face="Georgia"><li>Q: Are these fonts really free?</li><li>A: Yes they are. Some fonts such as <a href="http://www.typodermic.com/fonts/19.html">Neuropol</a> have expanded font families available for sale at <a href="http://www.typodermic.com/">www.typodermic.com</a> but the version you downloaded at Larabie Fonts is free.</li></font></ul><ul><font face="Georgia"><li>Q:
Your licence agreement states that the fonts can&#8217;t be altered. Does
that mean I can&#8217;t mess around with your fonts in
Photoshop/Illustrator/Publisher etc?</li><li>A: Those license
restrictions refer to altering the actual fonts themselves, not what
you make with them. As long as you don&#8217;t alter the font files in font
creation software such as FontLab or Fontographer you&#8217;re free to create
anything you like with them.</li></font></ul><ul><font face="Georgia"><li>Q: Can I use your fonts in a logo?</li><li>A: Yes. But check with a lawyer if you&#8217;re not sure. It&#8217;s okay with me if you use it but do so at your own risk.</li></font></ul><ul><font face="Georgia"><li>Q: Can I send you a sample of the nifty thing I created with your fonts?</li><li>A: Of course. Check <a href="http://www.larabiefonts.com/donation.html">www.larabiefonts.com/donation.html</a> for my current email or mailing address.</li></font></ul><ul><font face="Georgia"><li>Q: Can you make a custom font for me?</li><li>A: Possibly. Check <a href="http://typodermic.com/custom.html">typodermic.com/custom.html</a> for details. Keep in mind that making fonts is my full-time job so no freebies.</li></font></ul><ul><font face="Georgia"><li>Q: I want to sell software that includes you font files.</li><li>A: Contact me first at <a href="http://www.larabiefonts.com/email.html">www.larabiefonts.com/email.html</a>.</li></font></ul><ul><font face="Georgia"><li>Q: I want to sell rubber stamp alphabets, alphabet punches or stencil alphabets using your font designs.</li><li>A: Contact me first at <a href="http://www.larabiefonts.com/email.html">www.larabiefonts.com/email.html</a>.</li></font></ul><ul><font face="Georgia"><li>Q: My software won&#8217;t let me embed one of your fonts.</li><li>A: You may have an old version of one of my fonts. Uninstall it and install a current version on Larabie Fonts.</li></font></ul><ul><font face="Georgia"><li>Q: Can you help me find a font?</li><li>A: I really don&#8217;t have the time but if you send a donation, I can give it a try. If not. post your question on my font forum: <a href="http://www.larabiefonts.com/info.html">www.larabiefonts.com/info.html</a>.</li></font></ul><h3><font face="Georgia">LARABIE FONTS END-USER LICENSE AGREEMENT FOR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS</font></h3><h4><font face="Georgia">SOFTWARE PRODUCT LICENSE</font></h4><p><font face="Georgia">The
